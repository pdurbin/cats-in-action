About
-----

Erika Durbin created the artwork for Cats In Action and has defined the development roadmap below. The game is built using Phaser ( http://phaser.io ).

Roadmap
-------

- You have a cat to start with.
- Once you tap that cat once you get another of that kind of cat.
- You can put the cats together but you don't get anything.
- Once you put a cat together into another cat, it evolves.
- You keep making new cats.
- And then, when you want to start it over, press the circle button in the corner.
